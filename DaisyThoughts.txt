The bucket is frozen, never
Which hand the grasshopper?
Left you smile... greenly
Cranes weep... at tea
His hands... so cold, morning
Blue dives from pier... roam
EF6 7FT, past two in bush
Sweet wept in earth butter
Blades juicy, so juicy
Rorschach laughs, hide stains
Pound sun, back so toasty
In lemon waters, meat cools
I have eaten the plums
Saving for breakfast
Forgive me... they were
Delicious pineapples indeed
So sweet and so cold
Deluge such, cool and icy
Bats! 2 out of 3
Cataclysms lurk, bad eggs
Hungry like the 0xlf
Rotten oranges, How heroic?
Who is da coo? I is da coo!
Swing Swing
Down by the broken
treehouse under
The milky twilight
Beneath the green
green grass
12 Angry cows
